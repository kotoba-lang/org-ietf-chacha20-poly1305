  "[RFC 8439](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8439) §2.8
  AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305, in portable `.cljc`, with no dependencies.

  Written because `kotoba-lang/noise` reaches this cipher through
  `provider/{jvm.clj, noble.cljs, node.cljs}` — the AEAD is host-injected
  there, not implemented — and because HPKE (RFC 9180) needs one AEAD it can
  actually run. The workspace's dependency ledger recorded ChaCha20-Poly1305
  as available; that was a call site, not an implementation, and this closes
  the difference.

  ## Use

      (seal key nonce aad plaintext)   ; -> ciphertext || 16-byte tag
      (open key nonce aad sealed)      ; -> plaintext, or an :error

  `key` is 32 bytes, `nonce` 12. Bytes are `Sequential` collections of ints
  in 0..255.

  ## Three rules the format depends on

  **The nonce must never repeat under one key.** ChaCha20 is a stream cipher:
  two messages under the same key and nonce expose their exclusive-or, and
  the Poly1305 one-time key is derived from the same pair, so a repeat also
  reveals `r` and forgery becomes arithmetic rather than search. Nothing here
  can check this — it is a property of the caller's counter.

  **`open` compares the whole tag before returning anything.** A partial
  comparison that stopped at the first differing byte would leak the position
  of the mismatch; more importantly, returning plaintext alongside a tag
  failure at all is how unauthenticated data reaches an application.

  **This is not constant-time.** The tag comparison reduces over all sixteen
  bytes rather than short-circuiting, which is the shape a constant-time
  comparison needs, but timing is a property of machine code and no portable
  Clojure can promise what two JITs emit."
